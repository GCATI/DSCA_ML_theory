# Fundemental theories in Machine Learning

### Version 1.0

**Course Duration**

8 Hours

**Course Summary**

This course covers the fundemental topics in machine learning and prepare audience for more advanced topics (e.g. image processing, NLP, and deep learning) and practical courses such as training and application of machine learning algorithms in R and Python. The course includes combination of graphical presentation and intuition and essential mathematical notations. 

**Course Objective**

This course aims to:
* Provide a thorough introduction into probabilityb theory and statistical inference including maximum-likelihood and Bayesian approaches
* Introduce supervised learning methods: linear and nonlinear regressions and classification algorithms
* Introduce unsupervised learning methods: clustering, and dimensionality reduction
* Breif introduction to Directed Graphical Models with a case study/example.

*	Undrestand the fundementals of probability theory, bayesian rule and inference, and the characteristics of major probability distributions.
*	Get a good undrestanding of major supervised learning algorithms specifically linear in parameter regression, bayesian linear regression, and classification methods.
*	Get a good understanding of main unsupervised learning algorithms specifically clustering and data dimensionality reduction algorithms.
* Get familiar with directed graphical method as a technique of combining supervised and unsupervised learning into one modelling framework
* be prepared to built on their current knowledge or take on more advanced courses such as application of machine learning techniques in natural 
language processing  
* be prepared to apply their knowledge through formulating machine learning problems and coding using standard libraries (e.g. in R and Python)
