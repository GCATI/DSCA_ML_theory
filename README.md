# Fundemental theories in Machine Learning

### Version 1.0

**Course Duration**

8 Hours

**Course Summary**

This course covers the fundemental topics in machine learning and prepare audience for more advanced topics (e.g. image processing, NLP, and deep learning) and practical courses such as training and application of machine learning algorithms in R and Python. The course includes combination of graphical presentation and intuition and essential mathematical notations. 

**Course Objective**

* Provide a thorough introduction into probability theory and statistical inference including maximum-likelihood and Bayesian approaches
* Introduce supervised learning methods: linear and nonlinear regressions and classification algorithms
* Introduce unsupervised learning methods: clustering, and dimensionality reduction
* Brief introduction to Directed Graphical Models with a case study/example.

*	Get a good understanding of main unsupervised learning algorithms specifically clustering and data dimensionality reduction algorithms.
* Get familiar with directed graphical method as a technique of combining supervised and unsupervised learning into one modelling framework
* be prepared to build on their current knowledge or take on more advanced courses such as application of machine learning techniques in natural 
language processing  
* be prepared to apply their knowledge through formulating machine learning problems and coding using standard libraries (e.g. in R and Python)
